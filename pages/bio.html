        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px;">I'm Arman Mirzaei, a web development enthusiast currently studying Web Design. I’m highly interested in both the frontend and backend aspects of web development and love diving into the technologies that power the internet.

            From building responsive user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to exploring backend tools like Node.js and modern frameworks such as React, I enjoy every step of the development process. My long-term goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer capable of bringing complete web applications to life.
            
            I'm always eager to learn, experiment with new tools, and take on projects that push my skills to the next level.
